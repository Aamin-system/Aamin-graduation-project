By 31 December 2019, the world has faced the infamous COVIDâ€‘19 pandemic, also known as the
coronavirus [1]. that brought many challenges to our lives. One of the most important ones is to
keep our distance from each other which yield to help control the virus spread to sage and eliminate
it. Among those safety measures and precautions is maintaining a safe distance between people
and wearing the face mask during human gatherings. Where recent statistics indicate that
maintaining a safe distance and wearing a mask helps prevent the spread of the virus by 90% [2].
But it is difficult to implement these procedures in crowd management, and human gatherings such
as markets, workplaces, schools and universities, and government service institutions (such as
passports and the labor office). Accordingly, the research team reached the design and construction
of a system that relies on artificial intelligence and drones technologies that allow the monitoring
and control feature over the human crowds and the detection of violations of safety procedures and
precautions regulations - human distancing and preserving wearing face masks, in addition to
measuring body temperature, which can contribute to reducing the chances of spreading the virus
in any place where people gather.
